The following changes have been made to SIMv2.35
-----------------------------------------------

The checkinstall script has been modified so that the scratch is now
./tmp

========= CHANGES TO OLDER VERSIONS ===============
The following changes have been made to  SIMv2.33


1) Another bug fix was done to list.c

2) Sim now prints the version number in the output files.

3) The checkinstall script has been slightly modified.

Known Bugs:
==========

1) The bursty.c and bursty_nonuniform.c codes are undergoing testing 
    presently.


The following changes have been made to  SIMv2.31

1) The bug in the time average occupancy statistics has been removed. This 
change affects the following two files i.e. lists.c and config.c


The following changes have been made to  SIMv2.30
================================================

1) The SIM Configuration code broken out into config.c

2) The command line arguments for stand-alone (no config file) traffic parameters
   have been removed. 

   NOTE : The above is a significant change and users will now HAVE to specify the
		  same from a file only.

3) The various function tables for traffic, algorithm, fabric, inputAction
and outputAction have been rewritten to use a common structure
definition in functionTable.h.  functiontable.c contains common code for
finding the various functions. 

4) The INPUTACTION_CELL_CREDIT_ARRIVAL_CHECK call was renamed to 
INPUTACTION_PERCELL_CHECK for clarity.

5) LiteLists which cut the memory utilization way down been added.
 
6) An additional flag -R to all of the random traffic sources that
 allows you to specify the utilization of multicast cells to different priorities
 seperately from the utilization of uncast cells (as specified in -r) has been
 added. It still respects -m for deciding how much traffic to make 
 multicast and unicast, and then uses the -R values or the -r values to 
 pick a priority.  
 
7) A null traffic source has been added.

8) A modified trace traffic source to have priorities, multicast, and
 support input from pipes and compressed files has been added.
 
9) bursty.c has been modified in a minor way to remove some unimportant (and
 potentially confusing) intermediate values as it was parsing its -r string.

10) Bug Fix in slip_prime.

11) slip_prime renamed to islip and pri_slip_prime renamed to pri_islip.
    Changes made to SAMPLE_INPUTS/ISLIP and SAMPLE_INPUTS/PRI_ISLIP
 
12) Added priority check for default outputaction which cannot handle multiple priorities.

13) Chaned the = 0 bug, in islip and pri_islip. Changed the respective TEST_OUTPUTS for  
     tests involving islip and pri_islip. (previously known as slip_prime and pri_slip_prime)

14) Added new algorithms, pristrict_lqf, pristrict_ocf, pri_lqf and pri_ocf.

15) Removed support for "|" in trace files. 



The following changes have been made to  SIMv2.16 
================================================

1) Support for the following algorithms have been added.

mcast_tatra.c 
mcast_wt_fanout.c  
mcast_wt_residue.c 
future.c  
maximum.c
maxrand.c 
neural.c 


2) A new version of checkInstall has been added.



The following changes have been made to  SIMv2.15 
================================================

Support for the following algorithms have been added.
==================================================

lpf_delay.c  
ocf.c       
wfa.c      
wwfa.c    
rr.c     
mcast_slip.c 
opf_delay.c 

Changes made to previous releases.
=================================

The following changes have been made to  SIMv2.14 
================================================

Support for the following scheduling algorithms have been
added:

1) gs_lqf.c
2) gs_ocf.c
3) lqf.c
4) ilpf.c
5) ilqf.c
6) iocf.c
7) iopf.c

The following changes have been made to  SIMv2.11
================================================

Support for the following scheduling algorithms have been
added:

1) mcast_conc_residue.c
2) mcast_dist_residue.c
3) lpf.c
4) opf.c

The following changes have been made to  SIMv2.10
================================================

1) Support for simgraph has been added. sim can now interface with a Java
   tool to report statistics and graph them during execution time.

2) Added createsim, a shell script through which sim is compiled.

3) Files added:  aux.c,aux.h,graph.c,graph.h and createsim


The following changes have been made to  SIMv2.01
================================================

1) Priorities are being supported. A new option -p for the levels of priority
   to be supported and -r for the ratios amongst them are supported.

2) Whenever a multicast option is specified but no values are given to it
	 then the multicast fraction defaults to 0.5

3) A smaller and cleaner set of algorithms are supported. So is the case
	 for FABRICS, OUTPUTACTIONS and INPUTACTIONS.

4) SAMPLE_INPUTS has sample input files.
	 TEST_INPS and TEST_OUTPS contain test files. The outputs are available in
	 TEST_OUTPS. checkInstall is a script to create and compare the sim outputs.
