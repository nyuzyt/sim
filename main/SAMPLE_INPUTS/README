1) DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
======================

The directories all contain test input files pertaining to the 
	 specific traffic patterns,algorithms etc.

2) Naming Conventions:
=====================

Include extension 'p' when priority is there, else no extension
Include extension 'u' when only unicast traffic else
Include extension 'm' when multicast traffic is there.


Examples:

.pm - We have both multicast traffic as well as priorities built
	  into them

.u  - Only unicast traffic. No priority is there among cells.
